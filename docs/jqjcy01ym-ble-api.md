### BLE & GATT

The basic technologies behind the sensors communication are [Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy) and [GATT](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt).
They allow the devices and the app to share data in a defined manner and define the way you can discover the devices and their services.
In general you have to know about services and characteristics to talk to a BLE device.
