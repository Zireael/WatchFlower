## About CGD1

* Qingping (formerly ClearGrass) 'Bluetooth Alarm Clock' [CGD1](https://www.qingping.co/bluetooth-alarm-clock/overview) are alarm clock with hygrometers
* Has onboard clock and alarm
* Has sensors to relay temperature and humidity
* Uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and has a limited range
* 2 * AA batteries are used as power source

## Features

* Read real-time sensor values
* Read historical sensor values
* Temperature and humidity sensors

## Protocol

The device uses BLE GATT for communication.  
Sensor values are immediately available for reading.  

### BLE & GATT

The basic technologies behind the sensors communication are [Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy) and [GATT](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt).
They allow the devices and the app to share data in a defined manner and define the way you can discover the devices and their services.
In general you have to know about services and characteristics to talk to a BLE device.
