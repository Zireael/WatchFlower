WatchFlower is a **plant monitoring application** that reads and plots data from compatible Bluetooth sensors like Xiaomi MiJia "Flower Care" and "RoPot" or Parrot "Flower Power" and "Parrot Pot", as well as many Bluetooth thermometers!
It works with international and Chinese Xiaomi devices, doesn't require an account creation, your GPS location, nor any other personal data from you!

Works on Linux, macOS, Windows, but also Android and iOS! Desktop binaries are available on the "release" page, mobile applications are on the app stores.  
Virtually all phones have Bluetooth "Low Energy", but you will need to make sure your computer has BLE capabilities (and for Windows, a working driver too).  

> Available in Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Spanish and Russian!

> Application developed by [Emeric Grange](https://emeric.io/). Visual design by [Chris Díaz](https://dribbble.com/chrisdiaz).
